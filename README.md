# Overview of Election Audit
The primary purpose of this analysis is to understand the election results both in terms of the candidates as well as the counties. The analysis includes 
 - The total vote count across all candidates and counties
 - Voting results for each candidate
 - Voting results for each county
 - Winning candidate results
 - County with the highest voter turnout

Voting results were measured based on each candidate's or county's total votes, as well as the perecentage of votes received out of total votes cast.


# Election-Audit Results

Overall, there were 369,711 votes cast during the election.

## County Election Results
Each county's total votes were calculated. Based on the results, the county with the highest turnout, based on number of votes, was Denver.

#### Votes by County:
- Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
- Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
- Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
- County with highest number of votes:  Denver

# Election-Audit Summary
The script written for this analysis was created specifically to count the votes per county and votes per candidate. With a few modifications, this code can be applied to other election analyses. 

## Additional Usage #1 
Using the same election data, this analysis could be modified to breakdown each candidate's votes by county. We could also breakdown each county's votes by candidate. The election results data is present and could support this analysis. The current code creates lists and dictionaries based on the county and candidate separately. See code snippet below. If this code was modified to use multiindex series (hierarchical indexing) then this type of analysis could be performed. 

```
# Candidate Options and candidate votes.
candidate_options = []
candidate_votes = {}

# 1: Create a county list and county votes dictionary.
counties_list = []
counties_votes = {}
```

## Additional Usage #2
The code cana also be used for different election types including county- or city-level elections, such as a mayoral election. If different election data was provided in the same format/structure as the current CSV (columns of ballot/vote information, geographic location, and candidate name), the code would need only minor changes to support analyzing a different election type.

For example, if the election_results.csv file was provided with city information in index 1 instead of county, a few changes could quickly be made to support the use of city in the file. The suggested changes are listed below. 

### Required Modifications
The below modifications to the code would be requried to be changed for a city mayoral election analysis. If the data structure of the CSV file was the exact same then to support a city analysis would not require changes to the code since the index of the city data would be the same. The only change required would be to the output text.

- Line 89: Change to reference "City" instead of "County"
- Line 119: Change to reference "City" instead of "County"

### Suggested Modifications
The below code snippets are highly suggested to be modified for a city mayoral election analysis. The references to "County" or "Counties" should be changed to "City" or "Cities", respectively. These should be changed for ease of code understanding and use. It is best practice that the code, even if it works "as-is" to read the data, be modified to refer to what the index represents. 

```
# 1: Create a county list and county votes dictionary.
counties_list = []
counties_votes = {}
```

```
# 2: Track the largest county and county voter turnout.
county_winner = ""
county_turnout_win = 0
county_percent_win = 0
```

```
        # 3: Extract the county name from each row.
        county_name = row[1]
```

```
        # 4a: Write an if statement that checks that the
        # county does not match any existing county in the county list.
        if county_name not in counties_list:

            # 4c: Begin tracking the county's vote count.
            counties_votes[county_name] = 0

        # 5: Add a vote to that county's vote count.
        counties_votes[county_name] +=1

        print(county_results)
        txt_file.write(county_results)
         # 6f: Write an if statement to determine the winning county and get its vote count.
        if (cvotes > county_turnout_win) and (cvote_percentage > county_percent_win):
            county_turnout_win = cvotes
            county_percent_win = cvote_percentage
            county_winner = county_name
